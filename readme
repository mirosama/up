We have made a JSON storage server in Node.JS with a OpenMCT plugin talking to that server for persisting the objects/infrastructure/etc.


## Step 1
You have to extract the net-persistence-server tar.xz archive separately and run it via npm start on the same machine where OpenMCT runs.

```
npm start
```

## Step 2
For net-persistence tar.xz archive, you have to extract the files inside a folder named "net-persistence", and this folder should be inside the OpenMCT folder. 


## Setp 3
Then you have to edit index.html of OpenMCT, remove the line "platform/persistence/local", and add my OpenMCT bundle inside this file.

To give a clue how index.html script tag should look:

```

<script>
require(['openmct', 'net-persistence/bundle'], function (openmct) {
[
'example/imagery',
'example/eventGenerator',
'example/generator',
'net-persistence',
'platform/features/my-items',
// 'platform/persistence/local'
].forEach(
openmct.legacyRegistry.enable.bind(openmct.legacyRegistry)
);
openmct.start();
});
</script>

```




Little notes: I do not know how it scales up with concurrent users. OpenMCT may override parts of the data in case of conflicts since it does not think it is especially shared. But I don't think doing a conflict resolution is needed without evidence there is a problem with that.
